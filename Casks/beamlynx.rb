  # GitHub's macos-latest runner has been Apple Silicon (arm64) since 2024,
  # and electron-builder.yml's mac.target doesn't set an explicit arch
  # array, so the published dmg is arm64-only. Decided to ship arm64-only
  # for now rather than add an Intel (x64) leg to release.yml's package
  # matrix first -- most Macs from the last ~4 years are arm64, and this
  # restriction means an Intel colleague gets a clear "not supported"
  # instead of a cask that installs but doesn't launch. Revisit if that
  # turns out to matter.

  app "beamlynx.app"

  # electron-updater is bundled and active (src/main/auto-update.ts calls
  # checkForUpdatesAndNotify unconditionally) -- it will keep the app
  # current independent of Homebrew. Setting auto_updates true stops
  # `brew upgrade --cask` from fighting it by reinstalling over a
  # newer-than-catalog copy.
  auto_updates true

  # release.yml builds unsigned/unnotarized (see SIGNING.md). Homebrew Cask
  # quarantines downloads by default, so Gatekeeper may block first launch
  # until the user right-clicks > Open, or the app is code-signed &
  # notarized upstream. Confirmed only in theory here -- no Mac was
  # available to test this cask end-to-end before drafting it.
  caveats <<~EOS
    This build is unsigned. If macOS Gatekeeper blocks the first launch,
    right-click beamlynx.app in Finder and choose Open, or run:
      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "#{appdir}/beamlynx.app"
